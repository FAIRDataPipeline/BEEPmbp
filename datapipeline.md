# Data pipeline

* Code for interfacing with pipeline being written by Ian Hinder. 
  * He is currently on holiday so I haven't been able to get the latest information on data pipeline.

* C++ code either reads files locally or through the pipeline (by means of Python). 
  * As far as I know reading is possible, but an implementation of writing files to the pipeline is not yet finished.

* Richard Bailey is the data broker for BEEPmbp model. 
  * As of the end of July he has placed some data files into the data pipeline.
  * At that point he found the procedure rather difficult.
  * He thought it would be better to have some way to automate the whole thing in R.  

* BEEPmbp currently uses the following datasets:
  * Hospitalisations per day on a national level
  * Hospital occupancy per week on a healthboard level
  * Hospilatised deaths per week on a national level
  * Community deaths per week on a national level
  * Total deaths per week on a healthboard level

  * Matrix of MSOA interactions gained from census flow data (Stephen Caterall)

  * Age mixing matrices from Prem et al. paper

  * Unofficial priors for latent and infectious periods and asymptomatic fraction (it would be better if there is a more official version in the pipeline?).
